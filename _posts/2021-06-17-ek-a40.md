Hi all,
this is the thread for a custom kernel i made for Samsung Galaxy A40.
The custom kernel has been named Eureka which is a greek work which means "I have found the solution". This multi-purpose kernel is the solution for battery, gaming, performance on A40. On creating this kernel, I believed that 1 kernel can be all of the above if properly tweaked!
This kernel can only be used on Q vendor based roms, that is, oneui 2.x, Q/R GSIs, Q/R Eureka Roms.
For ONEUi 3.x, another thread will be created where the kernel will be posted.

Compatibility:
This kernel has 2 versions. One version has enforcing selinux and the other one has permissive selinux. So, please download the correct version.

### FEATURES:
* Disabled Samsung security features
* Enabled all governors except Schedutils governor.
* Overclocked CPU as follows:
BIG Cores: from 1768 MHz to 2288 MHz.​
LIL Cores: from 1586 MHz to 1690 MHz.​
* Underclocked CPU as follows:
BIG Cores: from 936 MHz to 520 MHz.​
LIL Cores: from 839 MHz to 449 MHz.​
* Added GPU thermal and voltage control
* Added latest boeffla_wl_blocker V 1.1.0 and disabled some wakelocks
* Network speed improvement
* Enable zram support and set default compressor as lz4.
* Switch to a lower charging voltage more quickly.
* GPU max frequency overclocked from 845 MHz to 1300 MHz
* Implemented Dynamic FSync 2.0
* Has Spectrum support
* NOT ROOTED with magisk as from now
* Upstreamed kernel version from 4.4.177 to 4.4.241 which is the latest stable version.
* Built with Linaro V6.5.0 toolchain. Reason: Better performance
* FOR GSI:
* Fixed ADB and MTP.​
* Set SElinux as permissive

Please read the changelog on github for full list of changes.

### KNOWN ISSUES:
* Maybe ADB cannot be used at the same time as MTP

### SOME MINOR TWEAKS FOR BEST GPU PERFORMANCE:
* Set GPU power policy to "always on"
* Set min and max GPU frequency to 1200/1300 MHz
* Disable GPU thermal manager to prevent GPU frequency from dropping
* Games don't require high CPU frequency because they depend more on GPU. You can therefore decrease CPU max frequencies to reduce heating of the device.
